ideas on how to solve the injkection problem I'm facing. 29.6.19:


1. get the dom element that the selected text is in, and edit its inner html 
1.1 in which way will you be editing the innerhtml of the selected text's parent object ? which functions will you be using ? 


as I've thought of it, there are a few steps to the process.


first, there's the copying of the text you would like to translate.
second, you can choose extension copy vs regular old copy. ctrl-c vs ? 
third, once you use the extension copy an information box pops up where you started/ended copying.



first: there are 2 events associated with the selection of text, mousedown and mouseup.
second: look  up how to add custom keyboard in a chrome-extension.
third: embed a popover next to the selected text.

second: make this last - attack an extension to handle an event of using keyboardboard event.


third: make a simple webpage with some text on the localhost.
	1. get the dom element in which the selected text lies in.
	2. modify the color of the selected text.
